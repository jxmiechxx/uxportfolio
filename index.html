            <h3>Jamie was born in Queens, NY but grew up in Ridgefield, NJ her whole life.
                <br>
                In her free time, she is a compulsive rater; rating things from movies, tv shows and books.
                <br>
                <br>
                Although she graduated with a Computer Science degree,
                she was inspired to explore UX Design when her mentor at her job did a 5 minute Tedtalk
                on user experience. After that, she earned a Google Certificate in Professional UX Design.
                <br>
                <br>
                While Jamie had dabbled in website development and front-end development in university, she grew an interest
                in being involved in the website making process from the very beginning that also included
                the "why" aspect. She fell in love with the research side of UX Design as well as the collaborative
                environment that is necessary when completing a UX project.
